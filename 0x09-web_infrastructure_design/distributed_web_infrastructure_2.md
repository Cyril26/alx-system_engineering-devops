# Web Infrastructure Design

## 1. Distributed Web Infrastructure

### Challenges with the Current Infrastructure

- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**  
  The system is vulnerable to a single server failure leading to the entire network's collapse.

- **Security Vulnerabilities**  
  The lack of security measures leaves the infrastructure susceptible to malware attacks and interception by third parties, compromising the confidentiality of data transmitted between systems. There's an absence of firewalls and HTTPS.

- **Lack of Monitoring**  
  Real-time monitoring of server health and performance is unavailable, preventing timely assessment and response to potential issues.
